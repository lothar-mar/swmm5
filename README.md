SWMM5 is public domain software by the EPA (www.epa.gov)

From the EPA site:
"Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is used throughout the world for planning, analysis and design related to:

stormwater runoff,
combined sewers,
sanitary sewers,
and other drainage systems in urban areas
with many applications in non-urban areas as well.

This general purpose urban hydrology and conveyance system hydraulics software is a dynamic rainfall-runoff simulation model used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of subcatchment areas that receive precipitation and generate runoff and pollutant loads. The routing portion of SWMM transports this runoff through:

a system of pipes,
channels,
storage/treatment devices,
pumps, and
regulators.

SWMM tracks:

the quantity and quality of runoff made within each subcatchment,
and the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel

during a simulation period made up of multiple time steps. EPA has recently extended SWMM 5 to explicitly model the hydrologic performance of specific types of low impact development (LID) controls, such as:

porous pavement,
rain gardens,
green roofs,
street planters,
rain barrels,
infiltration trenches, and
vegetative swales.

The updated model allows engineers and planners to accurately represent any combination of LID controls within a study area to determine their effectiveness in managing stormwater and combined sewer overflows.

SWMM 5 was produced in a joint development effort with CDM, Inc., a global consulting, engineering, construction, and operations firm.
