SWMM5 (version: 5.1.012)
=====

SWMM5 is public domain software by the EPA (www.epa.gov)

From the EPA site:
-----------------

"Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is used throughout the world for planning,
analysis and design related to:

+ stormwater runoff,
+ combined sewers,
+ sanitary sewers,
+ and other drainage systems in urban areas
+ with many applications in non-urban areas as well.

This general purpose urban hydrology and conveyance system hydraulics software
is a dynamic rainfall-runoff simulation model used for single event or
long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily
urban areas. The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of
subcatchment areas that receive precipitation and generate runoff and pollutant
loads. The routing portion of SWMM transports this runoff through:

+ a system of pipes,
+ channels,
+ storage/treatment devices,
+ pumps, and
+ regulators.

SWMM tracks:

the quantity and quality of runoff made within each subcatchment and the flow
rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during
a simulation period made up of multiple time steps. 

EPA has recently extended SWMM 5 to explicitly model the hydrologic performance
of specific types of low impact development (LID) controls, such as:

+ porous pavement,
+ rain gardens,
+ green roofs,
+ street planters,
+ rain barrels,
+ infiltration trenches, and
+ vegetative swales.

The updated model allows engineers and planners to accurately represent any
combination of LID controls within a study area to determine their
effectiveness in managing stormwater and combined sewer overflows.

SWMM 5 was produced in a joint development effort with CDM, Inc., a global
consulting, engineering, construction, and operations firm.
